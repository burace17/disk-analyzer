# Disk Analyzer

This is an exploratory redesign of a disk analyzer program in rust. The original project's GUI was written in GTK, but this one sought to utilize the Iced framework. Iced does not come with a pre-existing directory interface, so the UI was ultimately scrapped and brought down to a bare bones display. The main focus was on practicing some redesign concepts on the core logic. Most of the outcomes of this work can be found there.
